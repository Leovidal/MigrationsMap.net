        <h2>What is it?</h2>

        <p>The <a href="http://migrationsmap.net">map</a> allows you to see for every country X in the world either the
            top ten
            providing countries of lifetime migrants to X or the top ten receiving countries of lifetime migrants from
            X. On
            top of that, when you let your mouse hover over a country, you can see the total population, the GDP per capita,
            the HIV and Tuberculosis prevalences and the death rate of children under five</p>

        <p>I (<a href="http://twitter.com/madewulf">Martin</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/madewulf">De Wulf</a>) have
            been
            programming this map to
            learn
            and have fun with <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/">HTML5</a> technologies. Besides of learning, my only goal is to create a
            website that can make people think.


        </p>


        <h2>The data</h2>
        The data for the map is coming from three sources:
        <ol>
            <li>
                The <a href="http://www.migrationdrc.org/research/typesofmigration/global_migrant_origin_database.html">Global
                Migrant Origin Database</a>
                is the main source of the data. As said on the site, it "consists of a 226x226 matrix of
                origin-destination stocks by country and economy".
                Put differently, this is a matrix showing for each pair of country X and Y "the number of persons born
                in a country X and now living in
                country Y." Globally, the map is only as good as this data is and it is quite clear, even for a non
                specialist like me, that
                obtaining accurate number on such topic is really difficult: you have to use many different sources with
                different
                counting criteria, and for some country, it would probably be better politically not to give the precise
                numbers.
                So, take the map with a grain of salt.
            </li>
            <li>For all the indicator (population size, GDP, HIV and tuberculosis prevalence and mortality for kids under five years old), I
                used the  <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/api-overview">World Bank API</a>, with the numbers for 2007.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the countries borders, I used a file found in the examples of the <a href="http://polymaps.org">polymaps</a> library, which
                 originated from <a href="http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php">thematicmapping.org</a>
            </li>

        </ol>
        <h2>The Technology</h2>
        <p> All the code of the site and the scripts used to produce it are available on
        <a href="https://github.com/madewulf/MigrationsMap.net">github</a>. Furthermore, the site is hosted on a <a href="http://pages.github.com/">githup page</a>. Thanks to them for this
        fantastic free service.</p>
        <p>Here is a non exhaustive list of technologies or tools employed to create this map:
        <ul>

        <li><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael.js</a> for displaying in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> the countries borders, the "arrows" and animating everything, all </li>
        <li>For the red hues used to display "migration intensity", I used  the <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/">Color Brewer</a> by Cynthia Brewer;</li>
         <li>The font is <a href="http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/foundry/univers-else/">Univers Else</a> (I may have put it to bad use... not sure, I am not a type geek);</li>
         <li><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> has been used, with the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html">Requests</a> library
           to transform all data in a format usable on this site and to access the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/api-overview">World Bank API</a>;</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/millermedeiros/Hasher">Hasher.js</a> for the url hashes manipulation (so that people can bookmark maps, or use their back button);</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> for detecting if the current browser supports  geolocation;</li>
        <li><a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>.</li>
        </ul>
